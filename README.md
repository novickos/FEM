# FEM

The program simulates transient heat transfer on a 2D plate model, using the Fourier equation to describe unsteady heat flow.

The created program is capable of calculating the maximum and minimum temperatures over a given time period, with very high accuracy in most cases. While not perfect—mainly due to approximation errors—the results are close to the correct values.

Is it sloppy? Heck yeah it is.

Did I cry in the process of coding this? Yeah...

But have I learned a lot from it? Yeah!!
